---

## 1.2.3, 2016-05-02

* Updated for KSP 1.1.0.

---

## 1.2.1, 2015-11-14

* Fixed a bug with loading/saving the intuitive maneuver node handles option.
* Fixed a bug that occurred when patched conics were not yet available in career mode.

---

## 1.2.0, 2015-11-10

* Updated for KSP 1.0.5.
* Added intuitive behavior for maneuver node handles (code by TechnocratiK.) This can be enabled
  in the options window. The intuitive behavior is most useful for normal/anti-normal burns
  (ie. inclination changes.)
* Orbit information now also shows the inclination.
* Fixed a bug in the Kerbin/Earth time conversion.
* Disabled KSP compatibility check for the time being.

---

## 1.1.3, 2015-05-02

---

## 1.1.1, 2014-10-09

## 1.1.0, 2014-08-02

  right-clicking acts as minus.
* Fixed some bugs in the calculations of ejection angle and ejection inclination.
* If activated in the options, the conics window is now always displayed regardless of the
  visibility of the main window.

---

## 1.0.0, 2014-07-27

* In addition to the automatic update check, the plugin now also gets KSP versions
  from the update check server. In case the currently running KSP version is one of
  those versions, the plugin will not complain about being incompatible with this
  KSP version. This saves both players' and the plugin author's time.
* Updated for KSP 0.24.2.

---

## 0.14, 2014-07-25

* Updated for KSP 0.24.1.

---

---

## 0.12, 2014-06-10

* Added new buttons "MS" and "MR" to memorize and recall the current maneuver node's settings,
  respectively.
* DN/AN buttons should no longer flicker if the relative/equatorial inclination is almost zero.

---

## 0.11, 2014-04-09

* The button "Focus Vessel" should now work as intended.
* Time and duration displays should now honor the Earth time/Kerbin time setting.
* Added a button to delete the current maneuver node.

---

## 0.10, 2014-04-02

* Added a new option to show/hide conics controls in the main window.

* The RP-9f Craft Locator (the part that saves maneuver nodes into the save file) has been removed.
  KSP itself can save maneuver nodes now.
  Note: For the time being, your existing craft should be fine. You simply cannot select the part
  in the editor any longer. Be advised to replace existing craft using this part because it will
  be removed permanently at some future point. You should be able to remove it from craft files in
  the editor.
* The buttons to modify a maneuver node's time will be disabled now if they are not applicable with
  respect to the node's current time.

---

## PreciseNode 0.9

* Added a PartModule to save and load Maneuver Nodes: ModuleNodeSaver.
  * No additional parameters are needed, there are no right-click options.
* Talisar provided a part for ModuleNodeSaver.
  * The RP-9f Craft Locator is available under the Control parts section.
  * In career mode it is under Advanced Flight Control for 8000 unlock, 1200 price.
* a.g. provided code to fix an issue with Unity on Linux where hotkeys were being
    activated even while a text field had focus.
* Added Majiir's compatibility checker for KSP version checking.
  * This will not disable any functions, it is purely used for warning the user.
* Added the ability to merge a node with a previous node on the Trip Info screen.
* Replaced the +/-10K time buttons with AN/DN snap buttons.
  * If you have a target the buttons will snap to AN/DN of the target, otherwise
    they will snap to the equatorial AN/DN.
