PreciseManeuver
===============

PreciseManeuve plugin for Kerbal Space Program

Provides a window for more precise maneuver node editing.

![Screenshot of the Precise Maneuver main window](/../screenshots/PreciseManeuver1.png?raw=true "Precise Maneuver Window")

The modular structure allows you to disable all the unneded components and make a window as small as you want.

NOTES:
--------------
Works with KSP 1.3

BUILD:
--------------
.NET v3.5 is required.  
Both Visual Studio on windows and Monodevelop on linux are able to build the project. Just open the .csproj file.  
The libraries are expected to be found in /Libs folder:
```
UnityEngine.dll
UnityEngine.UI.dll
Assembly-CSharp.dll
Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll
```
All four files can be taken from the KSP_Data/Managed directory of your KSP installation.  
Also, you will need the AssetBundle file with unity prefabs, which can be generated in Unity Editor from prefabs in /Prefabs folder. The asset bundle name is expected to be 'precisemaneuverprefabs'.

INSTALLATION:
--------------
Unpack the plugin into GameData folder inside your KSP installation.  


USAGE:
--------------
The toolbar icon will appear during the mapview, and by pressing on it you can enable and disable various components of the plugin.

The components are:
- **Maneuver Pager**, allows to switch between maneuvers, focus on the current maneuver and delete it
- **Maneuver Presets**, allows to save and load the parameters of the maneuver
- **Precise Input**, allows to change the current maneuver precisely by the use of "+" and "-" buttons
- **Orbit Tools**, allows to turn the orbit in normal/antinormal direction for a precise angle, to circularize the orbit, and to copy/paste the maneuver. The copy/paste format is similar to the Transfer Window Planner, and the maneuver can be pasted from it. 
- **Maneuver Gizmo**, is the maneuver gizmo that looks very similar to the stock gizmo, and behaves in a similar way
- **Next Encounter**, shows the next encounter, allows to focus on it and shows the distance to it in the closest point (PE)
- **Ejection angles**, shows the ejection parameters in case the orbit escapes from the SOI of the celestial body
- **Orbit Info**, shows the parameters of the planned orbit
- **Patches Control**, allows to change the mode of Patched Conics draw, i.e. the trajectories of the vessel

The following hotkeys are available by default:
- Keypad8/5: increase prograde/retrograde
- Keypad4/6: increase/decreas radial
- Keypad7/9: increase/decrease normal
- Keypad1/3: increase/decrease time
- Keypad2: switch different modes for trajectories (+alt for reverse)
- Keypad0: raise the increment step (+alt for reverse)
- "P": hide/show the window (all the hotkeys excluding the trajectories controls will stop working)

Other keybindings are available, but are disabled by default.
